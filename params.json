In 2012, 437 nuclear fission reactors generated 10.3% of the worldâ€™s electricity. A further 67 reactors were under construction, more than at any point since 1988. Nuclear energy will play a crucial role in the low-carbon energy mix. \r\n\r\nNuclear energy systems are split into four generations of  technology. Gen IV technology has four goals; to improve the sustainability, economics, safety performance and proliferation resistance of nuclear energy systems. The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) was established in 2001 to coordinate the research required to realise next generation reactor designs [3]. Six key emerging technologies are highlighted by the GIF. A brief overview of the technology and a summary of research progress is given in this paper.\r\n\r\n![Four Generations of Reactor Technology](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2952791/4516594/5a75e744-4bff-11e4-8692-730d02e299b0.png)\r\n\r\n###Report\r\nFind the Report here: [Report.pdf](https://github.com/TheSmiff/Report---COMP6033/blob/master/IRR.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n###Presentation Poster\r\nFind the A1 Poster here: [Poster.pdf](https://github.com/TheSmiff/Report---COMP6033/blob/master/IRRPoster.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n###Contact\r\nFor further information: [Thomas J Smith](mailto:tsmiff@live.co.uk)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
