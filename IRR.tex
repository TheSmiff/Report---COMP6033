% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


\usepackage{mdwmath}
\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.

\usepackage{todonotes}
\usepackage{multirow}
\newcommand{\inote}[1] {\todo[inline]{#1}}
\usepackage{longtable}



\usepackage{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/

\usepackage[acronym]{glossaries}


% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
%\usepackage{hyperref}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{E}{nergy} security, sustainability and affordability are key challenges confronting global energy policy. 
2050 electricity demand is expected to increase by a minimum of 27\% compared to 2010. 
This is attributed to the electrification of transport and heating in developed countries and increasing demand in developing countries \cite{Kim201}.
This insatiable demand for more energy must be reconciled with combating climate change and lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and has led to a rekindled interest in nuclear power in recent years \cite{schneider2012nuclear}.

Generating electricity from nuclear fission is a well established science and has been used to supply low-carbon power in commercial quantities since Calder Hall opened in October 1956 \cite{NDA2007}.
Most of the worlds' reactors were built between 1965 and 1975 with the peak number of grid connections in 1984 \cite{Guidolin20121746,schneider2012nuclear}, just prior to the Chernobyl catastrophe in 1986.
By the end of the 1980s, the upward trend in nuclear capacity had ended \cite{schneider2012nuclear}.

While a full scale ``nuclear renaissance'' was thwarted by the multi-reactor incident at Fukushima in 2011 \cite{Guidolin20121746}, nuclear energy remains an important base-load resource in the low-carbon energy mix. 
%In 2013, the IAEA recorded 437 operational reactors and a further 67 reactors under construction \cite{IAEAReactors2013}.
In 2012, 437 nuclear fission reactors generated 10.3\% of the worlds' electricity\footnote{Calculated from IAEA nuclear total generation \cite{IAEAReactors2013} of 2,346TWh and Enerdata total electricity production value of 22,619TWh \cite{Enerdata}.}. 
A further 67 reactors were under construction \cite{IAEAReactors2013}, more than at any point since 1988 \cite{schneider2012nuclear}.
As a new generation of reactors enter the construction phase, it is pertinent to consider the technology of the reactors under construction and the reactors of the future.

\section{Evolution of Reactor Technology}
Nuclear energy systems are generally split into four generations of technology. 
The first experimental and prototype systems were built between 1950 and 1970 \cite{GenIVRoadmap} and are referred to as Generation I.
These include examples of PWR, BWR, Magnox and fast reactor technologies \cite{goldberg2011nuclear}\cite{Bhatnagar2011}. 

Generation II systems are reactors that were deployed between 1970 and 1990, following the OPEC-oil crisis in 1974 \cite{Bhatnagar2011}.
These commercial sized systems form the bulk of the reactors operating today. The majority of Gen II systems use PWR technology, although there is a significant numbers of BWRs, and a minority of AGRs, VVER and CANDU reactors \cite{IAEAReactors2013}. 
These reactors are claimed to have exemplary safety and commercial performance \cite{Locatelli2013, goldberg2011nuclear, Bhatnagar2011, GenIVRoadmap} despite the incidents at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima.

Many of the 67 reactors currently under construction will be Gen III or III+ designs \cite{IAEAReactors2013}, representing evolutionary improvements over Gen II reactor designs \cite{Marques2010a}. 
Such improvements include the standardisation of designs for licensing purposes, simpler modular designs, the greater use of passive safety systems and reduced core melt frequency \cite{schneider2012nuclear, Marques2010a}. 
Gen III systems are currently being considered for, or under construction at \cite{IAEAReactors2013}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Areva EPR - Flamanville France, Olkiluoto Finland, Hinkley Point and Sizewell UK
\item Westinghouse AP-1000 - Moorside UK, Sanmen and Haiyang China, Vogtle USA
\item GE Hitachi ES-BWR - Fermi USA
\end{itemize}
These systems are expected to continue to dominate the new build market for the coming decade \cite{Marques2010a}.

Gen IV technology has four goals; to improve the sustainability, economics, safety performance and proliferation resistance of nuclear energy systems \cite{GenIVRoadmap}. 
These designs are likely to be available for commercial deployment beyond 2030, when most of the world's current reactors will reach the end of their operational life \cite{schneider2012nuclear}. 
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) was established in 2001 to coordinate the research required to realise next generation reactor designs \cite{Marques2010a, GenIVRoadmap}. 
Six key emerging technologies are highlighted by the Gen IV International Forum \cite{GenIVForum} and are introduced in Table \ref{table:GenIV}.

\begin{table}[!t]

\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The underpinning concepts of the highlighted Gen IV technologies are not entirely new. 
All of these technologies have been previously studied in various levels of detail prior to the formation of the GIF \cite{Marques2010a}. However, there is a marked removal from past approaches. 
Three of the six Gen IV technologies are fast reactors as opposed to the thermal reactor designs dominating past generations.
Fast reactors utilise unmoderated neutrons that have the capacity to convert fertile material into fissile fuel, increasing the uranium efficiency by around 50 times \cite{Locatelli2013}. 
Four of the six technologies use a closed fuel cycle as opposed to the once-through cycle currently used. 
Closing the fuel cycle presents significant societal benefits, namely the reduction of nuclear waste through better actinide management \cite{GenIVRoadmap, Bhatnagar2011}. 
Gen IV systems will achieve much  higher operating temperatures than current designs, promoting the use of nuclear energy for co-generation. 
Using high temperature reactors for hydrogen production could be critical in a post-petroleum society \cite{ Bhatnagar2011}. 

In the following sections, the state-of-the-art research into the highlighted technologies is collated and presented.


\section{Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor}
SFRs are one of the most mature Gen IV technologies \cite{Marques2010a}. 
Worldwide investment in the development and demonstration of SFRs already exceeds US \$50billion \cite{Int2012}. 
By utilising fast-spectrum neutrons and closed fuel recycling, SFRs present significant improvements in fuel utilisation and is one of the nearer term options for managing plutonium and minor actinide waste \cite{GenIVForum}.

Liquid sodium is an excellent coolant. 
It is inexpensive, liquid within a wide operating range $93^{o}C-883^{o}C$ and undergoes very little radioactivation \cite{Sakamoto2013194}. 
Sodium is chemically compatible with stainless steel when closed within the reactor, but reacts violently with air and water \cite{Int2012, Sakamoto2013194} which has caused several fires at SFR experimental facilities.
Although none of these fires have caused any radiological leakage \cite{Int2012}, there is a continuous effort to reduce leak occurrence and mitigate the fire risk. 
Various techniques have been developed including the Karlsruhe tray \cite{Huber1975155}, implemented at Superph\'{e}nix in France \cite{Int2012}, whereby leaking sodium is caught and stored in an air and water free environment. 
The Gen IV forum are actively addressing safety concerns such as these \cite{GenIVRoadmap}.

There are several potential configurations of SFR concerning power output and layout. 
The layout could be chosen to be a pool-design as experimentally proven at EBR-II in the US, or a loop design as first proven at BR-10 in Russia \cite{Int2012}. 
The JSFR is a 3570MWth SFR design consideration in Japan and will use a loop confirguration. 
Prior to construction starting, the two layouts were compared considering criteria such as construction cost, technical feasibility, In Service Inspection \& Repair (ISIR) and potential for cost redution \cite{Sakamoto2013194}.
The pool layout presented some significant advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item reduction in leakage probability due to fully enclosed primary circuit.
\item higher thermal inertia which is beneficial in an accident scenario.
\item most experiemented form.
\end{itemize}
but the loop layout was chosen due to economic competitiveness \cite{Locatelli2013}. 
The loop design has scope for cost savings through changes to the secondary loop, including the reduction in piping length and the integration of the intermediate heat exchanger and primary circulation pump \cite{Sakamoto2013194}. 
Other SFR designs such as Korean KALIMER design and the BN-800 currently under construction in Russia and China adopt a pool design. Despite the Japanese claims, the pool layout also presents opportunity for cost efficiency by reducing piping length and adopting innovative core internals \cite{Locatelli2013}. It remains to be seen which of these designs prevail, and will largely come down to the combined construction and operational costs which will be verified by these demonstration projects.

Another key design decision is the size of the reactor. 
While it is necessary to consider the economies of scale, not all SFR designs are large commercial power reactors greater than 1000MWth.
There are several Small Modular Reactor (SMR) designs utilising sodium as coolant, including the Toshiba 4S, a pool design of just 10MWe \cite{Locatelli2013}. 
The PRISM reactor offered by GE Hitachi is another pool type SFR of 311MWe output \cite{Locatelli2013}. 
The NDA is considering deploying a PRISM reactor in the UK to deal with the 140 tonne stockpile of civil plutonium \cite{NDA14}. 
The design is based on the EBR-II reactor in the USA, and this experience-based design combined with a small unit size means the licensing and construction time combined is just 14-18 years\cite{NDA14}.

There remains several performance related challenges to overcome before the SFR can be deployed commercially. 
SFRs have been built and operated successfully in France, Germany, India, Japan, Russia, the UK and the USA meaning a considerable amount of construction and operating experience has already been gained \cite{Int2012}.
The Gen-IV forum has organised these challenges into several working groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item System Integration and Assessment Project - to track and integrate global R\&D approaches and experience.
\item Safety and Operations Project - 
\item Advanced Fuel Project - 
\item Component Design and Balance-of-Plant Project - to enhance the performance of the SFR for economic feasibility. 
\item Gloabal Actinide Cycle International Demonstration Project - to demonstrate on a significant scale actinide management by fast reactors.
\end{itemize}


\section{Very High Temperature Reactor}
The VHTR concept is a helium gas cooled, graphite moderated design planned for an open fuel cycle \cite{Marques2010a}.
The main purpose of this reactor is to achieve extremely high core outlet temperatures. The Gen IV forum target for this technology is to reach over $1000^oC$ \cite{GenIVRoadmap} as opposed to $320^oC$ for current LWRs and around $500^oC-700^oC$ for Gen IV SFRs and MSRs \cite{Bhatnagar2011}.
The increased temperature improves the thermodynamic efficiency of the system.
The GT-MHR developed by General Atomics is expected to reach efficiencies of 47\% operating at $850^oC$ \cite{Marques2010a} compared to around 30\% for current LWR designs.
More importantly, the high outlet temperature increases the potential for co-generation.
 Process heat is currently used in oil refining, metallurgic processes and synthetic hydrocarbon production.
Temperatures in excess of $750^oC$ are required for hydrogen production, either by the thermo-chemical iodine/sulphur process or the high-temperature electrolysis of steam.
The VHTR is one of the few clean technologies

%\section{Historical Background - Generation I and II}
%Nuclear fission reactors are conventionally divided into four generations. The first nuclear fission reactors provided the foundation for the civil nuclear power programme, and are referred to as Generation I designs. These reactors were built between 1950 and 1970  \cite{Locatelli2013, Bhatnagar2011, Marques2010a} and include:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Shippingport (1957-1982) - Pennsylvania USA - PWR design \cite{goldberg2011nuclear}
%\item Dresden-1 (1960-1978) - Illinois USA - BWR \cite{goldberg2011nuclear}

%\section{The Generation III Evolution}
%Many of the 67 reactors under construction will be Gen III or III+ designs \cite{IAEAReactors2013}, representing evolutionary improvements in efficiency, modularisation and safety features over Gen II reactor designs \cite{goldberg2011nuclear}. 
%Particularly Gen III+ designs feature advanced passive safety systems \cite{schneider2012nuclear}, and are currently being considered for or under construction at \cite{IAEAReactors2013}:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Areva EPR - Flamanville France, Olkiluoto Finland, Hinkley Point and Sizewell UK

%\section{The Generation IV Revolution}
%Generation IV (Gen IV) systems represent a revolutionary step in technology. By utilising state-of-the-art materials and fuel cycles, Gen IV systems are designed to achieve sustainable and efficient use of fissile fuels, optimise nuclear waste management and enhance safety performance, economic competitiveness and proliferation resistance \cite{GenIVForum}. These designs are usually 10-30 years from commercial deployment and face considerable research and development challenges \cite{goldberg2011nuclear}.
%Six key emerging technologies are highlighted by the Gen IV International Forum \cite{GenIVForum} and include:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR)
%\item Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR)
%\item Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor (SCWR)
%\item Gas Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR)
%\item Lead Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR)
%\item Molten Salt Reactor (MSR)
%\end{itemize}
%
%\section{The Future of Fast Reactors}
%Three of the six key emerging technolgies are fast reactors, that is reactors that make use of fission induced by fast or unmoderated neutrons. 
%
%\subsection{Sodium Cooled Fast Reactors}
%One of the most heavily researched next generation designs is the SFR and feature a fast breeder reactor with a closed fuel cycle \cite{GenIVForum, Bhatnagar2011}. This means the SFR can use fertile material to fissile material, increasing fuel efficiency by 50 times.

%\item Identify the key improvements offered by Gen III+ and Gen IV reactor technology.
%\item Case study some of the key Gen IV research areas. Only the most promising two of three technologies will be selected since it is impossible to cover six technologies in any meaningful depth within the scope of this report.
%\item Identify key barriers to commercial realisations and speculate on the state of future reactor design - are any of these designs likely to be implemented commercially?

% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
